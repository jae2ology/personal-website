        <h2>Undertale!</h2>
      <p>Undertale is such a beautiful game. It has actually been my favorite game for the past 6 years! The coding in this game creates unique actions that set the precedent for games after it. Such as, closing the program and the game with change, or the ability to create a randomized event based on a number when you first open the game. The creators of Undertale were ahead of their time :)</p>

    <h2>KinitoPet!</h2>
       <p>KinitoPet is a newer, upcoming indie horror type of game, similar to Doki Doki Literature Club. But the coding in this game is extraordinary! Using files on your personal computer, being able to search up your location, although very virus-like, it creates a very compelling story!</p>
